# MarketFinance C# Backend Coding Exercise
At Sloth Enterprise, we offer our customers 3 different products.
* Select Invoice Discount
* Confidential Invoice Discount
* Business Loans

Each product has different application criteria and is hosted in its very own microservice. Sloth Enterprise provides a single service : `ProductApplicationService` as a nexus for these 3 microservices. The said service is hosted in this project.

This project consists of a single service that receives a single customer application for a specific service, then routes it to the respective product microservice.

This code was written by a baby sloth some time ago and needs a bit of TLC.
